### What is it:

Cue Cal is an open source scheduling tool for theaters, performance groups and arts organizations. The idea is to make it easier for them to organize rehearsals, performances, stage times, etc.actions

Here's a rough walkthrough of what it can do at the moment:

- Manage multiple productions
- Multiple locations (rooms, stages, etc.)
- Members and member groups
- Automatically generated first-call times at the top of the calendar

### To Do:

- [x] After creating first location, redirect to production page
- [x] Allow adding users directly to an event~~
- [x] Rich text event description field

Marketing landing page

## Maybe:

Recurring events?
